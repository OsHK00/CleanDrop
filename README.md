# 📂 DownloadsOrganizer
A lightweight, automatic download organizer for Windows that sorts files arriving in your **Downloads** folder (or any path you configure), moving them to subfolders by file type.

This project works in real time: every time a new file appears in the monitored path, the program detects it and automatically moves it to the corresponding folder (images, documents, executables, audio, video, etc.).
